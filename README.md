# The Infernal Canyon
This project is a small in-terminal game made using ncurses.

## How to build
Make sure to have the `ncurses` library on your computer as well as a C compiler (like clang or GCC).
Just clone the repo and then `clang game.c -o game -lncurses`. Then you can `./game` and then the game is started! 

## Keybinds
Only a tiny amount of key are useful :
- q/Q : move left
- d/D : move right
- p : quit the game from the "Game Over" screen
